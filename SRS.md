1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the requirements for the Inventory and Supply Management Microservice API. It details the intended functionality, performance, and constraints of the system. The goal is to provide businesses with a reliable, scalable, and easily integrable solution to track, manage, and monitor their inventory levels.

1.2 Scope
The Inventory and Supply Management Microservice API will handle the following core functions:
	•	Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) inventory items
	•	Track stock levels, including low-stock items
	•	Provide stock adjustments and reorder triggers
	•	Offer authentication and authorization to ensure secure access
	•	Integrate with external systems (e.g., e-commerce platforms, ERP systems) via RESTful APIs
This microservice will be a standalone component deployed in a cloud environment, accessible via HTTPS, and maintainable through version-controlled code repositories.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
This microservice operates independently but can integrate with larger systems. It follows a microservice architecture, exposing REST endpoints. It relies on a database for persistent storage and can be integrated into a broader application ecosystem.

2.2 Product Functions
	•	Manage product entries (items) with identification fields (e.g., SKU, name, category, quantity, minimum threshold).
	•	Retrieve lists of all inventory items or filter by various attributes.
	•	Update quantities and product details.
	•	Delete obsolete or incorrect product entries.
	•	Retrieve items that are at or below a specified low-stock threshold.
	•	Generate reorder suggestions based on defined thresholds.
	•	Support user authentication and rate limiting.

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
	•	Warehouse Manager: Manages day-to-day inventory and will use the API to update stock levels, add new items, and review low-stock alerts.
	•	Inventory Analyst: Reviews inventory data, low-stock reports, and reorder points to make informed purchasing decisions.
	•	System Integrator: Integrates the microservice with other systems (e.g., online storefronts, ERP solutions).

2.4 Operating Environment
	•	Deployed in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
	•	Runs on Linux-based servers or containers (e.g., Docker)
	•	Accessible via HTTPS endpoints
	•	Uses a relational or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)

2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
	•	Must comply with RESTful API design principles
	•	Must implement secure communication using HTTPS
	•	Must use authentication (API keys or JWT)
	•	Must adhere to a standardized data format (JSON) for requests and responses
	•	Must implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
	•	Must support horizontal scaling as load increases

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
	•	Assume stable network connectivity in the deployment environment
	•	Assume the presence of a database instance accessible by the microservice
	•	Dependency on a logging and monitoring tool (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus) for performance metrics
	•	External systems are responsible for their own authentication when integrating with this API, but they must present valid credentials.

3. System Features
3.1 Inventory Item Management
3.1.1 Description and Priority
Allows CRUD operations on inventory items. High priority as it forms the core functionality.
3.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
	•	User sends POST /items with JSON payload (name, SKU, category, quantity, threshold). System creates an item and returns its ID.
	•	User sends GET /items to list all items. System returns all items in JSON.
	•	User sends GET /items/{id} to retrieve a specific item. System returns item details.
	•	User sends PUT /items/{id} with updated details. System returns success status.
	•	User sends DELETE /items/{id} to remove an item. System returns success status.
3.1.3 Functional Requirements
FR-1: The system shall allow adding new items with required fields (name, SKU, quantity).
FR-2: The system shall allow retrieving a list of all items or a single item by ID.
FR-3: The system shall allow updating item details (name, quantity, threshold) by ID.
FR-4: The system shall allow deleting an item by ID.

3.2 Low-Stock Reporting
3.2.1 Description and Priority
Provides a filtered list of items at or below a specified threshold. High priority to alert managers.
3.2.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
	•	User sends GET /stock/low. System returns all items below or equal to their threshold quantity.
3.2.3 Functional Requirements
FR-5: The system shall return items at or below the threshold quantity.
FR-6: The system shall allow specifying a custom threshold filter (e.g., GET /stock/low?limit=10).

3.3 Stock Adjustment and Reorder Suggestions
3.3.1 Description and Priority
Updates stock levels and suggests reorder actions. Medium priority.
3.3.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
	•	User sends PUT /items/{id}/adjust-stock with JSON payload { "adjustment": -5 }. System updates quantity and returns the new quantity. If below threshold, system flags the item for reorder suggestion.
	•	User sends GET /stock/reorder-suggestions. System returns items that need reordering.
3.3.3 Functional Requirements
FR-7: The system shall allow stock adjustments via increments or decrements.
FR-8: The system shall provide a reorder suggestion list for items below threshold.

3.4 Authentication and Rate Limiting
3.4.1 Description and Priority
Ensures only authorized users can interact with the API. High priority for security.
3.4.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
	•	User sends GET /items with a valid JWT token. System returns item list. Without valid token, system returns 401 Unauthorized.
3.4.3 Functional Requirements
FR-9: The system shall require an API key or JWT for authenticated endpoints.
FR-10: The system shall implement rate limiting (e.g., max 100 requests per minute per key).

3.5 Logging and Monitoring
3.5.1 Description and Priority
Collects request logs and performance metrics. Medium priority for maintainability.
3.5.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
	•	System logs every incoming request (method, endpoint, response status).
	•	Administrator accesses logs via a separate logging system.
3.5.3 Functional Requirements
FR-11: The system shall log all requests with timestamps.
FR-12: The system shall provide operational metrics (response time, error rates) to a monitoring tool.

4. External Interface Requirements
4.1 User Interfaces
Not applicable—this is a headless API service accessible via HTTP requests. Future integrations with dashboards or client apps are possible but not included in this SRS.

4.2 Hardware Interfaces
No direct hardware interface required. Runs on a cloud server or container-based platform.

4.3 Software Interfaces
	•	Database Interface: Uses a standard database driver (e.g., PostgreSQL driver).
	•	Authentication Service (if external): JWT token validation or OAuth 2.0 introspection endpoint if integrated.
	•	Logging and Monitoring: Integration with standard logging frameworks (e.g., Winston for Node.js) and metrics (e.g., Prometheus).

4.4 Communications Interfaces
	•	HTTPS REST endpoints accessible over the internet.
	•	JSON format for request and response payloads.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance Requirements
	•	The system should respond to requests within 200-500ms under normal load.
	•	The system should scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.

5.2 Security Requirements
	•	All communication must use HTTPS.
	•	Valid API keys or JWT tokens required for protected endpoints.
	•	Data must be stored securely, following best database security practices.

5.3 Reliability and Availability
	•	The system should be designed for high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
	•	Database replicas or failover strategies should be in place.

5.4 Maintainability
	•	Code should be modular and follow standard conventions for easier updates.
	•	Documentation of endpoints and usage must be maintained and updated alongside changes.

5.5 Portability
	•	The system should run in Docker containers for easy deployment on various cloud platforms.
	•	The system should not rely on platform-specific features that limit migration.

6. Other Requirements
	•	Versioning of the API (e.g., /v1/items) to handle backward compatibility.
	•	Graceful error handling with standard HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages.
	•	Pagination and filtering options for listing endpoints.
